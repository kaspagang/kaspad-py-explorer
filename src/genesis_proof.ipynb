    "\r\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to guide you through the process of verifying the authenticity of the Kaspa chain. That is, to show you how to cryptographically verify that the current UTXO set of Kaspa has naturally evolved from an empty UTXO set, validating the assertion that there was no premine.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As you might know, about two weeks after mainnet launched the network a major bug caused the network to split. The effects of the bug started to appear during Nov' 22, 2021, and by Nov' 23, 2021 the network was completely fragmented. To restart the network after fixing the bug, many users were asked to provide their node data prior to the crash. The devs examined the data to isolate the latest possible block known to most of the network, the chosen block is the block with hash\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "We call this block the `checkpoint block`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The new node was hardwired with a new genesis block whose UTXO set is identical to that of the block described above, which we call the `hardwired genesis`. The node data can only be used to authenticate the chain down to the hardwired genesis. (You can read more about the malfunction and how it was consolidated __[here](https://t.co/DhyAnxoU1t)__, __[here](https://t.co/MlxFT1svkX)__, and __[here](https://hashdag.medium.com/kaspa-black-tuesday-8c7f4fa35834)__. Also, it is impossible to prove from the node data alone that the UTXO set of the hardwired genesis indeed matches the UTXO set of the checkpoint block.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To fill in this gap, we asked the community to store copies of the data directory at the time of the crash (available e.g. __[here](https://mega.nz/file/rOJmhLIR#5j7wko32Mh0MlsQnC9yVG6jCvPql7Isqcyvgh3kmxKk)__). With this data available, all of the above could be verified.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The authentication process is as follows:\r\n",
    "<ol>\r\n",
    "<li>Verify the hashes of the pruning block chain. That is, verify that the hash of each header matches the hash stored in the header pointing at it (such checks seem tautological, e.g. it is \"obvious\" that \"the block whose hash is x has hash x\". However, relying on the assumption that the hash used to index the headers is the same as the hash used in consensus is insecure, and actually highly exploitable).</li>\r\n",
    "<li>Reconstruct the coinbase transaction with the payload hardwired into the code and verify that it hashes correctly.</li>\r\n",
    "<li>Verify that the hash of the checkpoint block matches the one advertised in Discord.</li>\r\n",
    "<li>To provide additional proof that the hardwired genesis block was created at the time specified above, the hash of the most recent Bitcoin block was included in the data committed to the genesis block. This is a cryptographic version of taking a picture with today's newspaper. Look up the hash in Bitcoin's block explorer and verify that its timestamp matches the time the network resumed operation.</li>\r\n",
    "<li>Recover the UTXO set of the checkpoint block from the stored data directory, compute its hash, and verify that it matches the UTXO commitment stored in the hardwired genesis header.</li>\r\n",
    "<li>Recover the pruning headers from the snapshot, and repeat the first step going from the hardwired genesis block to the original genesis block.</li>\r\n",
    "<li>Verify that the UTXO commitment in the original genesis block corresponds to an empty UTXOset.</li>\r\n",
    "</ol>\r\n",
